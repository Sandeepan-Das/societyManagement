For n1ql query atleast one index is required and can be made through UI

For opencvnodejs installation in ubuntu
- https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-opencv-on-ubuntu-20-04/  install open cv from source procedure

In package.json add this
"opencv4nodejs": {
    "disableAutoBuild": 1,
    "opencvIncludeDir": "/usr/local/include/opencv4",
    "opencvLibDir": "/usr/local/lib",
    "opencvBinDir": "/usr/local/bin"
  }

  Just check this path wether they contain anything related to opencv 
  dont need to worry about its contents

  $ cd ./node_modules/opencv-build
$ node install.js
